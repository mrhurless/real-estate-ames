#### Special note

There are 5 observations that an instructor may wish to remove from the data set before giving it to students (a plot of SALE PRICE versus GR LIV AREA will indicate them quickly). Three of them are true outliers (Partial Sales that likely donâ€™t represent actual market values) and two of them are simply unusual sales (very large houses priced relatively appropriately). I would recommend removing any houses with more than 4000 square feet from the data set (which eliminates these 5 unusual observations) before assigning it to students.

#### Floating Village Information
There is a zoning classification of FV for floating village.  This appears to be a flexible zoning type that allows for more "village" like development.  For the purposes of this analysis, these properties should be included.  ([source](https://www.cityofames.org/home/showpublisheddocument/659/637455425482600000))
